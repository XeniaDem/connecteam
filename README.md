# How to launch

## Installation

Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) to create a modern [React](https://react.dev/) app compatible with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)

In terminal, run the following command to clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/XeniaDem/connecteam.git
```

## Setup
1. Install Node.js to your machine. This can be done by clicking the [link](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. In terminal, cd into the cloned repository:
```sh
cd connecteam-main
```
3. Then install the dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
4. Start the app in your browser:
```sh
npm run start
```

## Goals

- Easy migration from Create React App or Vite
- As beginner friendly as Create React App
- Optimized performance compared to Create React App
- Customizable without ejecting

## Scripts

- `dev`/`start` - start dev server and open browser
- `build` - build for production
- `preview` - locally preview production build
- `test` - launch test runner

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/cra-template)
- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react)
- [Vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/tree/main/examples/react-testing-lib)
